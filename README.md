## Overview

This repository contains the code for the paper "Sa2VA: Marrying SAM2 with LLaVA for Dense Grounded Understanding of Images and Videos".

Sa2VA is the first unified model for the dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space.


## Model Zoo

We provide the following models:
| Model Name |                             Base MLLM                             |                                 Language Part                                 |                       HF Link                        |

## 🤗 Gradio Demos

We provide a script that implements interactive chat using gradio, which requires installing `gradio==4.42.0`. You can try it to build a local chat interface quickly.
```shell
PYTHONPATH=. python projects/llava_sam2/gradio/app.py ByteDance/Sa2VA-4B
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Our Sa2VA model is available on 🤗HuggingFace. With very few steps, you can try it with your own data. You can install the `demo/requirements.txt` to avoid training-only packages.


**Option1 - scripts:**

Supposing you have a folder (`PATH_TO_FOLDER`) that contains images of a video, you can use the following script to chat with the Sa2VA model or segment the objects in the videos.

```bash
> cd scripts
> python demo/demo.py PATH_TO_FOLDER --model_path ByteDance/Sa2VA-8B --work-dir OUTPUT_DIR --text "<image>Please describe the video content."
```

If the output contains the segmentation results, the results will be saved to `OUTPUT_DIR`.

**Option2 - Jupter Notebook:**

Please refer to `demo.ipynb`.
